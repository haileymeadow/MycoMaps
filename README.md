## About my Project

This project was developed to facilitate the study and analysis of Fungi and Protozoa species through modern data science tools. As an Environmental Science student, I became fascinated with microbiologic organisms such as Fungi and Protozoa after I completed a Mycology course during my bachelor's degree. Combining my love for these organisms, and a passion for technology 

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Datasets**: Includes diverse datasets on Fungi and Protozoa species, with metadata for easy integration.
- **R Scripts**: Pre-written R scripts for data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.
- **GIS Tools**: Resources and guides for incorporating these datasets into GIS software for spatial analysis.
- **Open-Source**: The repository is open to contributions and collaboration from the community.

## Datasets

The following datasets are included in this repository:

1. **Fungi Species Dataset**:
   - **Description**: Contains records of various fungi species, including geographic locations, ecological conditions, and other relevant attributes.
   - **Format**: CSV, GeoJSON
   - **Source**: Collected from fieldwork and public databases.

2. **Protozoa Species Dataset**:
   - **Description**: Includes data on protozoa species, with a focus on species diversity and distribution.
   - **Format**: CSV, GeoJSON
